Part 2: Reflection

->Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.
1. AI is a powerfull tool that can help me a lot, but I must be really carefull on how to use it because it can be tricky, and I can sabotage my progress. I like to ask questions that can help me get to my goal not to serve me with a solution.
2. AI can help me identify bugs in my code which I'm not able to see, VS code with exstensions can also help but sometimes AI is more helpful because it can explain the problem to me like I'm a chold and that can be really helpfull. ðŸ˜‚
3. AI can save a lot of time. 

->Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilotâ€™s suggestions to suit your needs?
Most often when my prompt is not good, I have to be careful in defining the prompt and be precise in order to get exactly what I want. Sometimes I'm not detailed enough and then he goes in a different direction of explanation, but that doesn't necessarily have to be bad because it's also an opportunity to learn if it's about something I don't know.

->How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?
Using Copilot just to generate code is like letting it do the work for you, and it can be tricky because you get results quickly, but you donâ€™t fully understand whatâ€™s happening or why it works. Using it as a learning partner is better because I can review its suggestions, experiment with them, and try to understand the logic before I try writing the code. For me itâ€™s like having a mentor or pair programmer who guides you and who is availabe every second I need. It is different because I can get a feedback faster which is proven to be the most efficient way to learn. 

->Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.
1. stagnation in learning
2. not understanding your code
3. if project gets too complicated AI cannot help you anymore so you will be on your own and you won't be able to continue
