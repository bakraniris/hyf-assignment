        Hi, I’m Iris, current HR Specialist and future FullStack developer with a strong passion for technology and people. My background in psychology shaped the way I understand motivation, communication, and teamwork, while my growing passion for software development opened a new path where creativity meets logic. Through exploring frontend development, I discovered how much I enjoy building intuitive digital experiences that make interaction feel natural and human. My goal is to combine my psychology knowledge with technical insight to create solutions that improve how people work, connect, and grow. Over the years, I’ve developed strong skills in recruitment, employee engagement, and process improvement, always guided by empathy and a data-driven mindset. I believe that transparency, curiosity, and continuous learning are key to personal and professional growth. Working with diverse teams has taught me adaptability and the importance of collaboration across disciplines. I love being in environments that challenge me to think critically while keeping people at the heart of every decision. Outside of work, I enjoy exploring new places, trying creative projects, and sharing ideas that inspire connection and change.
