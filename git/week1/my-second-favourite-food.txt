Cook the pasta in salted water according to the package instructions. Reserve about ½ cup of the pasta water.

Heat olive oil and butter in a pan.

Add garlic and sauté for about 30 seconds, until fragrant.

Add mushrooms and cook for 5–7 minutes, until they release water and turn golden brown.

Pour in the cream and bring to a gentle simmer.

Stir in parmesan, add salt and pepper, and a bit of pasta water if the sauce is too thick.

Toss the pasta in the sauce and cook for another minute to combine everything.
